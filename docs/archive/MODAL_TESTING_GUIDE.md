# Property Modal Testing Guide

## Issue Resolution

The property modal wasn't opening when clicking on property cards. This has been fixed by:

1. **Wrapping PropertyCard in clickable Box**: Material-UI Card components don't naturally support onClick events, so I wrapped each PropertyCard in a clickable Box component.

2. **Added Debug Information**: In development mode, you'll see a debug panel in the top-right corner showing:
   - Modal Open status
   - Selected Property ID
   - Test Modal button

3. **Enhanced Click Handling**: Added console logging and proper event handling.

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
cd /Users/benjamin/dreamery-homepage
npm start
```

### 2. Navigate to the Buy Page
- Go to http://localhost:3000
- Click on "Buy" in the navigation

### 3. Test Modal Opening
You have several ways to test:

#### Method 1: Click Property Cards
- Click on any property card in the listings
- The modal should open with detailed property information
- Check the browser console for "Property clicked:" messages

#### Method 2: Use Test Button (Development Only)
- Look for the debug panel in the top-right corner
- Click the "Test Modal" button
- This will open the modal with the first property in the list

#### Method 3: Check Debug Panel
- The debug panel shows:
  - "Modal Open: Yes/No"
  - "Selected Property: [property_id]"
- This helps verify the modal state

## Expected Behavior

### When You Click a Property Card:
1. **Console Log**: "Property clicked: [property_id]" should appear
2. **Debug Panel**: Should show "Modal Open: Yes" and the property ID
3. **Modal Opens**: PropertyDetailModal should appear with:
   - Property photos and carousel
   - Detailed property information
   - Multiple tabs (Overview, Photos, Details, Financial, Neighborhood, Agent)
   - Walkability scores (if available)
   - Amenities (if enriched data is available)
   - Demographics (if enriched data is available)

### Modal Features to Test:
1. **Photo Carousel**: Navigate through property photos
2. **Tabs**: Switch between different information tabs
3. **Favorite Button**: Click the heart icon to toggle favorites
4. **Close Modal**: Click the X button or outside the modal
5. **Responsive Design**: Test on different screen sizes

## Enhanced Data Display

The modal now includes sections for:

### Walkability Scores
- Walk Score (0-100)
- Bike Score (0-100) 
- Transit Score (0-100)

### Amenities (When Available)
- Nearby restaurants, cafes, grocery stores
- Healthcare facilities, parks, shopping centers
- Ratings and distance information

### Demographics (When Available)
- Population statistics
- Median age and income
- Employment rates
- Education levels

### Schools (When Available)
- Nearby educational institutions
- School types and ratings
- Distance information

## Troubleshooting

### If Modal Still Doesn't Open:

1. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check for "Property clicked:" messages

2. **Check Debug Panel**:
   - Verify modal state is updating
   - Check if property is being selected

3. **Try Test Button**:
   - Use the "Test Modal" button in the debug panel
   - This bypasses the card click handler

4. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Ensure property data is loading
   - Look for any failed API requests

### Common Issues:

1. **Property Data Not Loading**: Check if the Realtor API is running
2. **Modal Props Error**: Check if PropertyDetailModal component is properly imported
3. **CSS Issues**: Check if modal is opening but hidden behind other elements

## Next Steps

Once the modal is working:

1. **Test Enhanced Data**: Set up the external API services to see enriched data
2. **Test Responsive Design**: Try different screen sizes
3. **Test Performance**: Load many properties and test modal opening speed
4. **Test Accessibility**: Use keyboard navigation and screen readers

## External Data Integration

To see the enhanced features with real data:

1. **Set up API Keys**:
   ```bash
   export WALKSCORE_API_KEY="your_key"
   export GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY="your_key"
   export REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN="your_token"
   ```

2. **Start Enhanced API Server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   python start_enhanced_api.py
   ```

3. **Enrich Properties**:
   ```bash
   python enrichment_pipeline.py --limit 10
   ```

The modal will then display real walkability scores, amenities, demographics, and school data for properties that have been enriched.
